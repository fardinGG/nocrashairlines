Software Project Management Plan (SPMP)
Project Title: NoCrash Airlines - Flight Tickets for Passengers


Section 011 team 19


Phase 2 - System Design 
The class diagram models the core structural components identified in the Requirement Analysis phase. Passenger and Admin inherit from a common UserAccount class, reflecting shared login and profile features. The Passenger interacts primarily with the Booking and Flight classes to search, reserve, cancel, and modify reservations. Booking is associated with Flight and Payment to support ticket issuing and secure transactions. PaymentGateway and SystemDatabase represent external service interactions. This structure fulfills major FRs including user management, flight search, reservation, payment, and administrative management.
Also we used first 9 FRs for passengers, 6 FRs for Admins, and 5 FRs each for Airline Staff, Database and Payment
