Phase 1 - Requirement Analysis 
1. System Domain and Objectives
The NoCrash Airlines Flight Tickets for passengers system is designed to allow users to browse, book, and manage flight tickets efficiently through a digital platform.

Objectives:
* Provide a simple and user-friendly interface for passengers to browse and book flights.
* Automate reservation and ticket generation processes.
* Ensure secure handling of passenger details and payment transactions.
* Maintain up-to-date flight schedules and seat availability.
* Support cancellation, rescheduling, and refund policies.
